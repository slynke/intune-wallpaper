This project includes two scripts designed to set the desktop wallpaper on Windows devices seamlessly. The process occurs automatically after the first reboot following device enrollment in Intune and app assignment.

 	 First Script: Copies the wallpaper to the desired location on the client computer.

 	 Second Script: Updates the HKCU registry hive to apply the desktop wallpaper.

The app's detection logic ensures it runs only once, allowing end users to change the wallpaper later if desired.
